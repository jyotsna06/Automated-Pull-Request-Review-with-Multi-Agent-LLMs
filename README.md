# Automated-Pull-Request-Review-with-Multi-Agent-LLMs

1. Built a real‑time, multi‑agent LLM system that analyzes GitHub pull requests, fusing AST‑aware reasoning with SAST and OSV intelligence, and posts line‑anchored recommendations as PR annotations and checks
2. Implemented CI‑ready scanning and prioritization that mirrors GitHub code‑scanning UX, improving signal quality and time‑to‑fix for alerts raised in the Files changed and Conversation tabs
3. Delivered an ML‑first pipeline that ensembles agent outputs with Semgrep and dependency CVE lookups to maximize actionable findings while minimizing noise
